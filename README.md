## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- SCSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was a relatively easy challenge, so it was a good opportunity to reinforce essential skills: structuring project files, using SCSS partials, styling a centered object and the page footer. Overall the project took about an hour of work without any help from AI.

I used this approach to keep the footer at the bottom of the page, however I'd like to know if there is a better way of doing this:

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

main {
  flex: 1;
}
```

### Continued development

I used flexbox to make this component, but I'd like to build more complex layouts with grid property in future projects. Iâ€™d also like to try a component-based approach which I thought would be overkill for a such simple project.

### Useful resources

- [Transfonter](https://transfonter.org/) - I use this tool to convert `.ttf` fonts into `.woff2` optimized file format in almost every project.
- [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) - A useful service to check the validity of HTML structure.
